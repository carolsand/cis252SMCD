Part I Questions
1)	What are Sorting algorithms?
Set of instructions that arranges a list of elements in a certain order.

 Where can you get a comprehensive list of them online?
There are many resources online
List of Sorting Algorithms --  Wikipedia
GeeksforGeeks


2)	What are Searching algorithms? 
Step by step code, in programming, that locates a specific value among a collection of values. Searching algorithms can be fast or slow depending on how the search is implemented. There are generally two types linear search and binary search. Linear search is best with small data sample and unsorted. Binary search is better when the list is already sorted. 
Search algorithms make use of a ‘search key’

3)	How do you sort a list, implemented as an array, recursively?
Find the largest element in the array and swap it with the last element in the array, then recursively sort the array from the next-to-the-last element until you reach the first element in the array.



4)	What are the top 2 sorting and searching algorithms?
Explain why so…

Top Two Sorting Algorithms:
Quicksort – Because the time complexity is O(n log n) in the best case, O(n log n) in the average case, and O(n2) for the worst case. It doesn’t make any assumptions about the data. It can be done without taking extra memory.

Merge Sort – Divide and conquer algorithm. The order of equal elements is the same in the input and the output. Best-case performance – O(n log n), the average-case performance is O(n log n), the worst-case performance is – O(n).
