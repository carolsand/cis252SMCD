Part 1  -  LIST

Create an unsorted LIST class ( You should already have this code from a prior assignment ). Each list should be able to store 100 names.

 

Part 2 - Create a Class ArrayListClass

It will contain an array of 27 "list" classes.

Next, create a Class in which is composed a array of 27 list classes.

Ignore index 0... Indexes 1...26 correspond to the first letter of a Last name.

Again - ignore index 0.  index 1 is names starting with A, index 2 is B, index 3 is C...  index 26 is Z.

Create a file of 260 random ordered last names... 10 each for each letter… FileName: Names.txt

Have an constructor function that Reads in the Names.txt file, one name at a time, store/add each Name in the correct index LIST element.

( See File I/O lecture - this week if you need a review of File I/O - Do NOT turn in exercises in FILE I/o lecture)


Write a function that can Search for a Name to see if it in the LIST class.

Write a function that will print out the names starting with a specific letter, prints just ONE list.

Write a Function that can print out the ALL names found on each list..

HUGE HINT.. create a LIST class first, each that can hold 10 names.. Then create a class the can hold an array of 27 list classes.
=====

Be sure to include, after int main() this statement:     cout << “Your Name and date” << endl;

Turn in the Code and the screen prints of the successful execution of the program.

Write a conclusion of what you learned.
